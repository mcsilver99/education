## Project Overview

This project addresses inequality of educational opportunity in U.S. high schools. Here we will focus on average student performance on the ACT or SAT exams that students take as part of the college application process.

We expect a range of school performance on these exams, but is school performance associated with socioeconomic factors?

I will all see if there is an association between ACT score and student-teacher ratio. 

- **Objective:** To analyze what kind of socioeconmic factors, if any, affect average ACT score. 
- **Domain:** Education
- **Key Techniques:** Regression
